# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a Python project that uses pystructurizr for creating architectural diagrams and includes automated GitHub Actions workflow to render these diagrams and publish them to GitHub Pages. The project will use uv for modern Python package management and provide a streamlined workflow for maintaining and sharing architectural documentation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to set up a Python project with uv package management, so that I can manage dependencies efficiently and use modern Python tooling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is initialized THEN the system SHALL create a pyproject.toml file with uv configuration
2. WHEN dependencies are managed THEN the system SHALL use uv for package installation and virtual environment management
3. WHEN the project structure is created THEN the system SHALL include appropriate directories for source code, diagrams, and documentation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an architect, I want to create architectural diagrams using pystructurizr, so that I can document system architecture in code and maintain it alongside the project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pystructurizr is configured THEN the system SHALL allow creation of software architecture models using Python code
2. WHEN diagrams are defined THEN the system SHALL support multiple diagram types (system context, container, component views)
3. WHEN diagram code is executed THEN the system SHALL generate structured data that can be rendered into visual diagrams

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a team member, I want diagrams to be automatically rendered and published, so that the latest architectural documentation is always available without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to the main branch THEN the GitHub Actions workflow SHALL automatically trigger
2. WHEN the workflow runs THEN the system SHALL render pystructurizr diagrams into visual formats (PNG, SVG)
3. WHEN rendering is complete THEN the system SHALL publish the generated diagrams to GitHub Pages
4. WHEN publishing fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fail the workflow

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want the GitHub Pages site to display the diagrams in an organized manner, so that stakeholders can easily navigate and view the architectural documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GitHub Pages is accessed THEN the system SHALL display a clean, organized interface for viewing diagrams
2. WHEN multiple diagrams exist THEN the system SHALL provide navigation between different diagram types and views
3. WHEN diagrams are updated THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh the GitHub Pages content
4. WHEN the site loads THEN the system SHALL display diagrams with appropriate titles and descriptions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the project to include example diagrams and documentation, so that I can understand how to create and maintain architectural diagrams.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is set up THEN the system SHALL include sample pystructurizr diagram code
2. WHEN documentation is provided THEN the system SHALL include clear instructions for creating new diagrams
3. WHEN examples are included THEN the system SHALL demonstrate different types of architectural views
4. WHEN the workflow is documented THEN the system SHALL explain how the GitHub Actions automation works
